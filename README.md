## Project Overview

This project leverages Walmart sales data to build a predictive model that can estimate future sales based on historical trends. The process includes data cleaning, feature scaling, correlation analysis, and the application of a linear regression model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `walmart_sales_data.csv` and includes the following columns:

- **Store_ID**: Identifier for the store
- **Product_ID**: Identifier for the product
- **Sales**: Total sales of the product
- **Revenue**: Revenue generated from the product
- **Stock_Level**: Stock level of the product
- **Promotions**: Promotions associated with the product
- **Holiday**: Indicator for whether the sales were during a holiday period

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed, along with several Python packages. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```
3. **Run the Python script**:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
4. **Analyze the results**:
   The script will output the root mean squared error (RMSE), R² score, and several visualizations of the data and model predictions.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded using `pandas`.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are filled with the median of the respective columns.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Correlation Matrix**: A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlations between numerical features.
- **Missing Values Check**: The dataset is checked for missing values before and after preprocessing.

### Modeling

- **Linear Regression**: A linear regression model is trained to predict sales.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using RMSE and R² score.
- **Visualization**: The actual vs. predicted sales are plotted to visualize the model's accuracy.

## Results

The model achieved the following results:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: _value_
- **R² Score**: _value_

These metrics indicate the model's performance in predicting Walmart sales.
